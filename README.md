## Introduction
Hello my name is Dylan Perren. I am a Sophomore, and I am 15 years old. I am a triplet and am the oldest out of the 3. I like the dodgers. My favorite movie is home alone. 

My goal in life is to be very successful and create my own buisness. I also want to graduate college with a Gpa above 3.5 in high school. I also want to go to a good college and graduate from it. I also want to have a nice loving family. I also want to travel the world. I also want to go to every mlb stadium.


I like to play and watch baseball. I love the dodgers. I also like to watch football and I used to play flag football. I like to watch the 49ers but I like to watch everyone. I also used to do cross country and I still like to run when my knees do not hurt.
